# Keyboard Layouts

**What problems does this project aim to solve?**

## Keyboard Layout (Writer) — for writers, authors, editors, publishers.

### Problem

All the novels, essays, newspaper articles, etc — anything that is published — must follow specific rules outlined in the writing guides such as the famous “Chicago Manual of Style”.

For example the writing guides require writers, authors, publishers to use:
 · 66-99 quotation marks and 6-9 marks for quotations inside quotations,
 · En-dash, Em-dash, several types of hyphens — the hyphen-minus is a big no-no.
 · ellipsis, footnotes, endnotes, etc.

None of those symbols is available on the standard English QWERTY keyboard layout. Neither on Dvorak and Colemak.

Instead, writers must either:
 • memorize a list of Alt codes
 • laboriously copy the symbols from the CharacterMap or a similar app
 • or use an expensive software dedicated for writers that auto-magically replaces typed symbols with the correct ones.

Unfortunately "smart quotes" are not implemented in every text editor — **that is THE PROBLEM**.

### Solution
This keyboard layout allows you to type those most commonly used symbols with **AltGr** (right Alt key) and **AltGr+Shift**.
Now you can write your novel even in Notepad.

## Keyboard Layout (WriterX) - Extended with IPA symbols

Occasionally, some people (for example: English teachers) may need to write English IPA phonemes.
